Here is a collection of python code I have been working on. This is not one project, but a collection of all my educational efforts to learn and understand python as a whole. 
Each project is a bit different and focuses on different aspects of python. 
If you have any input on how to make it cleaner, more efficient or even new steps I haven't yet explored, please reach out to me view comments. Thank you for your time!
